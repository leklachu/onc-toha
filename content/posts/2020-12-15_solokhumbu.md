Last Sunday 29th November, my Sherpa friend, Ngawang Lhakpa Sherpa and I travelled to his remote village of Goli at 2,977 metres in lower Solukhumbu district. Despite only being 240 kilometres from Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, the journey took the best part of 12 hours to finally reach this secluded, mountainous and hilly part of the country.

Lhakpa is the locally elected village Chairman and seems to have been doing wonderful work to develop the local area; including extending the roads to higher parts, a new school in the neighbouring village, as well as supporting and fostering needy children from the community.

On the Monday, we visited Yarmakhu village about 40 minutes by bike from Goli. While we were there we spent quality time with the family members of four particularly needy children; Manoj (14 years old), Dasona (9), Tika (10) and Jikal (8). We gave all the children 10 copies each, a geometry box and some chocolate. After some discussion we have decided to buy all the children warm jackets for the very cold Winter months (temperatures as low as -10 degrees) as well as new sports shoes and socks. Now that the schools have opened in low risk Covid-19 parts of the country since the Nepali Dashain festival in October, some of the children have to walk up to 2 hours one way to school and back, as well as completing their homework, have sufficient rest and good food before repeating this arduous routine the following day.

We finished the day by visiting the village of Lhakpa’s birthplace, Nagthan where a primary school, Lumu Karma has recently been constructed. We gifted the children a football and had a wonderful time playing together until the sun began to set. Lhakpa’s wife is the day to day coordinator of the school. Many homes were damaged after the April and May 2015 earthquakes in the area, but it’s encouraging to see that things are more stable now; homes have been rebuilt and children have a school to attend.

The following day, we drove on a rather adventurous, roller-coaster road to the village of Maili, a good one hour by motorbike, or at least a 3 hour walk up and down the hills. We were in Maili for a program with Kamala Mai Basic School (Nursery Level to Class 8). Firstly, we met the Principal, Man Bahadur Khadka and were then introduced to two children from the school who were particularly in need of help; Temba, 7 years old, studying in Class 1 and Sunita, 10 years old, studying in Class 4. Sunita’s situation was particularly difficult and saddening too. Her mother had disappeared to another village and got remarried and had left her father, who was suffering from mental illness and elderly grandparents to care for her. We also met Saswoti, a 5 year old child whose father has been in jail for sometime over a local dispute, and it has been very difficult for the family to care for her. We gave copies and stationary to the children for their school learning. All of these three children require new school dress, warm winter clothes, shoes and socks, and further stationary and books to support their education in the coming months.

Following lunch with members of the school committee, we had a formal program with the whole school and distributed stationary and chocolate to every child at the school, which numbered about 100, including Class 9 students who were also present. This was very special, greeting and talking to every child in turn. Their beautiful smiles and their very warm welcome was very heart touching. I even was fortunate enough to teach an English conversation class to senior students in the school. I am very keen to return to the school in future to help students in English and provide teacher training with other experienced educators too.

We are very keen to help the children further that we met, especially with their education; providing school clothes, shoes, stationary, library books, sports equipment and more. The Principal of Kamala Mai Basic School also mentioned that they are lacking computers for students, especially given that Computer is a core curriculum subject. Please consider working with us to do more for such children and schools in Solukhumbu. Your thoughts and prayers are always appreciated.
