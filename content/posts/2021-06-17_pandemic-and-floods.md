Since my last update, the rate of new Covid-19 infections seem to be reducing across Nepal, although Kathmandu Valley is still registering up to 1,000 new cases every day. Less than a month ago the country had one of the highest transmission rates in the world (with a positivity rate of over 50%). This is now below 19%, with 2,014 testing positive on June 16th, down from 9,317 at its peak on May 11th. The death rate has also decreased from over 200 a month ago to barely 50 this week. 

Despite this decline, active cases still number 65,000 across Nepal, with most in home isolation, approximately 1,000 in ICU and over 300 on ventilator support. There is reason for some optimism, but still the vast majority of the population has not been vaccinated, with only 3 million doses so far being administered among its population of 30 million. 1.4 million people are still waiting for their second dose of vaccine. 

Restrictions have been eased a little. Unessential travel is still banned, police are still detaining vehicles disobeying the restrictions at checkpoints. Local grocery stores are now allowed to open until 11am and online delivery is now permitted. All schooling and higher education remains online. Dates for nationwide examinations still remain uncertain. 

Compounded with damaging consequences of the pandemic, the onset and opening week of the monsoon rainy season has already caused damage and destruction across central Nepal. One of the worst affected areas lies 40 kilometres northeast of Kathmandu, Melamchi Bazar in Sindhupalchok District. Over 50 people are reported missing, at least 7 have died, and infrastructure, including scores of houses, local bus parks, motorable and suspension bridges have been swept away by flash floods. Others areas of the district have also been devastatingly impacted. 

Nepali Times reported Radhika Shrestha, one of those displaced by the floods, recalling vividly how she managed to return from her field and warned her husband just in time to rush out to higher ground. The flood has taken away their land, properties and all key documents. The family will have to survive by manual labour or whatever means is possible. 

The floods have also wreaked havoc in parts of Manang District (famous for its Himalayan beauty and the Annapurna Circuit Trek), including the Headquarters, Chame and neighbouring villages. Many others parts of the country are also at high risk of flooding and landslides. This is only the seventh day of the monsoon season. More devastation is imminent. 

Please continue to pray for Nepal and its people, especially during these challenging times.
