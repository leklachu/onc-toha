It is now the 25th day of lockdown here in Kathmandu Valley since the respective local governments of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur issued a prohibitory order due to rising coronavirus cases. 
For the past three weeks, there have been over 8,000 recorded cases and approximately 200 deaths recorded every day. On Tuesday it was confirmed that the highly contagious double mutant Indian variant has been responsible for the Covid-19 surge in Nepal, especially in urban and Indian border areas of the country. The virus has even reached as far as Everest Base Camp (record numbers have been attempting to summit Mt. Everest, 8848.86m), where reports of over 100 mountaineers have been infected and evacuated to Kathmandu.

The Covid-19 wave is overwhelming the country’s health infrastructure. There is a severe lack of hospital beds and oxygen across the country. Most are packed and are only accepting Covid patients. The Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu is so packed that in some cases two patients share one bed. There are only 18,000 doctors (6 per 10,000) in Nepal with less than 2000 ICU beds and 700 ventilators in the country, mostly clustered in a few big cities. Around 50% tested are positive.

Domestic and international flights have all been suspended, with many unable to return home to visit families and their loved ones. The UK Government recently placed Nepal on its red list too, banning anyone from entering the UK (from here) except British nationals who would have to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days and pay a £1,750 charge.
 
Nepal had returned to some kind of normality since the end of 2020, with shops, educational institutions and schools, travel and tourism, restaurants and cafés opening up. However, now they are all closed again, except for essential services. Groceries stores are only allowed to open from 7 to 10 o’clock in the morning.

There was a mini exodus of people leaving Kathmandu Valley to return to their villages across the country once the lockdown was announced by the Nepal Government. However, the current situation has also meant that many people are currently out of work and are not receiving any form of income. This is particularly true for daily wage earners. It is now a struggle for many families and individuals to support their basic living while this adverse reality persists.

Fortunately though, the vaccination drive has restarted this week after a break of 3 weeks. 2.2 million have so far been fully or partially vaccinated, which is about 8-9% of the total population. However, there is still a serious shortage of vaccines despite the welcome support from the international community.

The children Operation Nepali Child (ONC) supports are generally doing well and are healthy, despite the grave situation in Kathmandu Valley. Both of the homes, Sharada’s Shelter for Children and Living Hope Nepal are coping, with the children mainly involved with their online classes during the week. The children have been taking their exams recently, which can be quite a challenge for them to concentrate and manage over the internet.

However, two families that we are connected with have been struggling considerably. Both are run by widowed single mothers with young children, who have lost their jobs working as cleaning and cooking staff in a local school and pharmacy. These are two of many families that have been adversely and harshly affected economically by this second wave of coronavirus which is sweeping across the country.

Please continue to pray for Nepal! Your thoughts and prayers are always appreciated.
