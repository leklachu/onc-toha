Operation Nepali Child (ONC) has been involved in helping and supporting victims of monsoon floods which have devastated parts of Nepal. 

Only July 16th (last month), ONC gave food relief support and aid to 10 families from villages in Sindhupalchok District near the town of Bahrabise. Their homes had been severely damaged, and in some cases destroyed by the intense flooding as a result of the heavy monsoon rains in the country. Besides food relief, we donated rice cookers and cooking utensils for each family.

Likewise, on August 4th of this month, ONC donated food relief to 20 families whose homes had been destroyed in Lamki Municipality of Kailali District. Food relief included: rice, lentils, oil, salt, noodles and biscuits for each family. Thank you to Garima Thapa and Madan Buda Chettri for helping coordinate this effort. 

Thank you also for all your prayers and support for those affected! 

Edward Turner

Founding Trustee of Operation Nepali Child
