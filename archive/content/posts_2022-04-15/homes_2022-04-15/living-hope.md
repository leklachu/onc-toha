Since the devastating 2015 earthquakes, Living Hope Nepal has been taking care of 8 children from poor and remote parts of Nepal.

The caretakers of the home, Tej Bahadur Singh and his wife, Shanti Singh grew up in an orphan home and this inspired them to help destitute, needy and orphaned children.

The children come from different backgrounds. For example, Sonu has no mother and father, who were both victims of the Maoist insurgency period in Nepal. David lost his mother when he was just 4 months old.

Kiran, Anisha, Kristina and Ishak have only one parent, but all come from broken backgrounds, where no one was providing sufficient care, support and education for them. In a few cases, the living parent has remarried or eloped with another and has abandoned the child concerned with no familial care or support.
